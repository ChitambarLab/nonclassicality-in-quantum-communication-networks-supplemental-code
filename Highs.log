Solving the presolved LP
WARNING: Number of OMP threads available = 0 < 1 = Number of HiGHS threads to be used: Parallel performance will be less than anticipated
Using EKK dual simplex solver - serial
LP  has all |entries|=1; max column count = 22 (limit 24); average column count = 7.3 (limit 6): So is not a candidate for LiDSE
